This is the Java client lib used by Minecraft to interact with the newly deployed public API for handling accounts and profiles at Mojang.

It's currently very limited and only allows player name <-> id resolution but we're aiming to add on this in the future. The only documentation is the code.

This code is provided as a courtesy and feel free to build a client in another language to share with the community.
