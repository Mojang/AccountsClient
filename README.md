This is the Java client lib used by Minecraft to interact with the newly deployed public API for handling accounts and profiles at Mojang.

It's currently very limited and only allows player name -> id resolution but we're aiming to add on this in the future. The only documentation for the API calls is [in the wiki](/Mojang/AccountsClient/wiki), the code has no documentation, and if you find something particularly weird it's probably a combination between not wanting to introduce unnecessary dependencies to Minecraft and not going overkill.

This code is provided as a courtesy and feel free to build a client in another language to share with the community.
