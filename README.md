# Mojang AccountsClient

This is the Java client lib used by Minecraft to interact with the newly deployed public API for handling accounts and profiles at Mojang.


## Description

It's currently very limited and only allows player name -> id resolution but we're aiming to add on this in the future.
If you find something particularly weird it's probably a combination between not wanting to introduce unnecessary dependencies to Minecraft and not going overkill.


## Documentation

The wiki contains [the documentation for the API calls](/Mojang/AccountsClient/wiki), the code itself has no documentation (yet).
